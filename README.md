# Stratagem: A Nonlinear Match-3 Game for the PICO-8

Stratagem (originally named Gemini) is a match-3 game for the
[PICO-8 fantasy console](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) where you swap
adjacent gems on a grid to gain points. Unlike other popular match-3 games, any
group of gems that directly touch on the grid are cleared, not just ones that
are in the same row or column.

While you can make any move on the board that swaps two touching gems, you can
only make three moves that don't clear groups of gems before the game is over.
